          <p>My academic background is in Industrial Design where I have worked on a variety of projects across different sectors, including branding, market research, marketing, consumer packaging, children's toys, women accessories and clothing.</p>
          
          <p>Ah yes, like many people out there, I made the leap for a career switch. After moving to Germany, starting a family and COVID hitting the world, I started my web development journey in 2021.</p>
          
          <p>Born in the United States, I grew up traveling back and forth between Taipei, Los Angeles and Columbus. I am fluent in both Mandarin and English. And now adding German to that list (not counting programming languages here).</p>
